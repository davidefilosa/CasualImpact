# Project objectives
## [Detailed Project](https://nbviewer.org/github/davidefilosa/CasualImpact/blob/master/Google%20Casual%20Impact.ipynb)


In this project we will try to understand what is the effect of Paypal's announcement to accept Bitcoins on their value.

Since a randomized experiment is not available, we will try to answer this question using a Bayesian structural time-series model. We will therefore use a set of control time series that have not been impacted by the same treatment (for example the price of other stocks that have had no impact from the Paypal announcement).

This model is then used to try and predict how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred.

We will try to predict what the price of Bitcoins would have been if Paypal had never made the announcement and then we will compare this value with what actually happened
